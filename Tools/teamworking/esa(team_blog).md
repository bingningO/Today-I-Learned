# esa (team blog)

[esa](https://docs.esa.io/posts) is a tool for team bloging .

Its concept is to make idea be communicated and improved. Which is very impressive.
(and the bird icon is cute > <)

In fact, now the motivation in my company for bloging is not very high. The most important thing is that people writing a blog can't reseive any comments which makes them feel little meaningful to write it.

But **esa** performs as chat to communicate and comment easily.
