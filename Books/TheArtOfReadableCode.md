# The Art of Readable Code

Very simple book and cover almost all situations of coding style we met in projects.

Some cases made me think, "oh, can coding like this ! and it's really easy to read ."

Such as a lot of values initialied, the way below is more readable :

```
int String string_a                     = "string a";
int String string_has_a_name            = "string name";
int String string_verrrrrrrry_long_name = "longgggggg name";
int String aaaa                         = "aaaa"
```

On the other hand, the unified coding style is more important than tring to use the most readable style in project.
So keep communication with team-members !
