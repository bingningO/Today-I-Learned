# Git Command: checkout new branch

We always use 
```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b [new_branch_name]
```
to create a new branch as copy of **develop**

but be aware that can't create a new folder with the same name of current branch, as git can't distinguish which is a folder and which is a branch file.

especial I always want to create develop/[tast_name] to be a sub branch of **develop**

then have to change to other names...
