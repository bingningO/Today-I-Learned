# VSM(value stream Mapping)

[VSM](http://courses.washington.edu/ie337/Value_Stream_Mapping.pdf) is a analytise method to improve your team work flow.

Analytise the whole work-flow from Release to custom to Planning.

Find the steps possible to delete or improve or automate.

It has been popular in Japan and here is [an easy explanation in Japanese](https://docs.com/ushio-tsuyoshi/7681/value-stream-mapping).

The develop leaders in my team has spended 4 hours by VSM to analytise our work-flow and finded out a lot of steps can be improved.

The first time to use VSM may cost time but record the result and keep it rotated and rotated, the team's work-flow can be improved better and better.
