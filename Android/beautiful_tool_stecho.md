# Stecho--- Debug Bridge

[Stecho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) is a very useful tool for Debug. 

install it in project, run Debug APK in devices, use chrome://inspect to check the status of the running Apk.

main usages :

1. Elements(View Hierarchy)
to check the view, can look into layout/view, at the same time the view in devices also be highlighted, and can be edited.

2. Network
to check the net requests(size, delay, etc.), and can use filter. other times I'd like to use [chareles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)

3. Resources
to check the local database, also Preference can be checked.
