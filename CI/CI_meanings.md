# what's the real meaning of CI

CI is known as **Continuous IntegrationCertification**

But how can we define it .

Be clear of :

1. everyone on their team commits and pushes to a shared mainline (usually shared master in git) at least daily.
2. each such commit causes an automated build and test.
3. when the build fails, itâ€™s usually back to green within ten minutes.
